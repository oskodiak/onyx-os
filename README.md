# Onyx OS

**Development Builds of Onyx OS**  
_A privacy-focused, clean, and professional Linux distribution built with Arch roots and long-term freedom in mind._

---

## ⚙️ Overview

Onyx OS is a custom Linux distribution built on top of the Arch base with inspiration and foundational structure from EndeavourOS. It is developed with the intent to balance professional usability, long-term system stability, and strong digital autonomy. Users will find a refined, minimal interface, tight security defaults, and curated package control — all while maintaining the power of Arch underneath.

This is not a hobbyist’s playground. This is a workstation-grade system with the polish and precision of an in-house build, tuned for real use.

## 🧭 Philosophy

- **Privacy-first**: Every default setting and bundled app respects user freedom.
- **No corporate tracking**: Your data is yours — full stop.
- **Minimal bloat**: You decide what you need. Onyx OS keeps the system lean.
- **Arch performance, Onyx polish**: Rolling release power, without the chaos.

## 🙏 With Humble Thanks

Onyx OS was made possible with the foundation laid by the [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) team and their fantastic i3 window manager integration. Special thanks to:

- **joekamprad** – for the original i3 setup inspiration
- **The Arch Linux Team** – for the rock-solid base

We strive to honor their work by building forward, not overwriting it.
